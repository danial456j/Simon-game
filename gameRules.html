                To start the game, press the "SPACE" button.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game will begin by lighting up and playing a sequence of colors and corresponding sounds. Pay close attention to the order in which the colors are displayed and the sounds associated with each color.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the sequence is played, your task is to repeat the same sequence in the exact order. You can do this by clicking on the colored buttons in the same order they were displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you correctly repeat the sequence, the game will add another color and sound to the sequence, making it longer. You need to continue repeating the sequence correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you make a mistake by pressing the wrong button or pressing the buttons in the wrong order, the game ends.
            </li>
            <li>
                As you successfully complete sequences, the game becomes more challenging by adding more colors to the sequence. Your goal is to achieve the highest level possible by repeating the longest sequence correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the game ends, you can choose to play again and try to beat your previous score.
            </li>
